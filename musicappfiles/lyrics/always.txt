We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
It seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you wanna be free
So I'm letting you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe
Our love will never die
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Oh, don't you know you can't escape me
Oh darling, you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time cannot erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Oh darling, you'll always be my baby
I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave just know
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
You'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Oh, don't you know you can't escape me
Oh darling, you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time cannot erase a feeling this strong, no
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Oh darling, you'll always be my baby
Oh yeah
Yeah
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Oh, don't you know you can't escape me
Oh darling, you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time cannot erase a feeling this strong, no
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Oh darling, you'll always be my baby
